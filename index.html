            <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep and happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">One of the oldest Monastery in Darjeeling. It is situated in peaceful and beautiful landscape just 15 minutes walk from Ghoom Railway Station. We can see religious God and Goddess paintings believed by Buddhism inside which can give spiritual power to one who prays there with clean heart. From the compound of Monastery on a clear day one can have a scenery of hills all around which is great for nature lovers.</p>

               <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you'll miss 40% of the fun. At minium: Infinity War Civil War Black Panther Age of Ultron AntMan and the Wasp. Problem is that the whole movie himage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot. There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles. Must go to the bathroom just before the movie because it does last 3 hours, all worthwhile.</p>

               <p>The Lion King movie is worth watching! ... Just the cast alone – Beyoncé, Chiwetel Ejiofor, James Earl Jones, Donald Glover – make it a must for the weekend. These days are stressful and the world needs some uplifting escapism and you'll find it here.</p>

               <p>Once again, the MCU delivers another great Spider-Man film. Anytime I go to these films I never feel disappointed with the results.

The humour is on point. Not only is there the witty comedy you’d find in a typical Marvel movie, but there are plenty of down-to-Earth, clever and hilarious moments which are easily relatable for awkward adolescents everywhere.

This movie is visually stunning, delivering plenty of jaw-dropping moments where you can tell that the VFX artists obviously care about making every action scene look excellent.

Finally, the performances from all the cast are great, but the real standouts are Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal. Holland once again solidifies his place as the best Spidey in a motion picture yet and while Michael Keaton did help to raise the standard for MCU villains, Gyllenhaal did more than enough to fill those big boots.</p>

               <p>Loved it! As a huge fan of the first movie, I had high hopes and they were met pretty well. Its not quite as good as the first one in my opinion but you can't really expect it to be. Frozen's original success was propelled by the surprise of seeing something so magical and so brand new on the big screen.
That being said, this movie has its own magic that defo makes it a worthy sequel. The character development was good; Elsa'a in particular was really touching. They all matured well and it was nice to see the bond between the two sisters as strong as ever. 
The plot itself was a bit wacky. I liked it but there was some stuff that didn't really make sense yet the whole thing still managed to wrap up nicely. The beginning was very sweet and the ending surprised me but it felt fitting, if not a little bit sad. 

2 things in particular:
 So catchy and well thought out. 'Into the Unknown' is the new 'Let it Go' for sure; I actually prefer it to the original. It sounds more mature but still has a ridiculously addictive chorus. The other songs weren't quite as good and some of them sounded similar but very nice none the less.</p>

        <div id="toy_story_4I know you have grown up watching Disney Pixar movies and you are bound to think that they make the best animated films for people beyond any age, time and culture, but believe me when I say Toy Story 4 sets some new benchmarks. It's the greatest story ever told and has everything to make you believe that these characters like Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Bo and all are not just toys but have become much greater with these 25 years in the making. 

The film gives justice to all the three prequels earlier made and has literally everything you want from a movie to make you feel. What I am trying here is to convince you, reading this is that no matter how much I or anyone else praises screenplay, direction, character build up, visualization, humour or the story of this film, at the end it's the amalgamation that matters and it's not just that but this feeling inside your stomach, mind and heart which tells you that you have lived every minute of this film and you are proud about it." class="collapse">
